# Mod 1 Project

## Description

For the Mod 1 project, the problem posed is as follows: Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.

## The Data

The datasets used for this include tn.movie_budgets.csv and rotten_tomatoes_movies.csv which are included as zipped files in this repo, just unzip and you're good to go.

## Project questions to be answered with data

What types of movies make the highest profits at the box office?
What types of movies make the most at the box office?
  Are these different? How so? Why?
Does the season of the movie release relate to how well the movie performs at
the box office?
  How so? 

## Python Modules

import pandas as pd
import datetime
import matplotlib 
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

This is included in the student.ipynb file but they must be included in the modules you have active via python.

## Included
pdf presentation
video presentation
python notebook with visualizations
link to blog post in student.ipynb

### Visualizations
should visualizations appear with black border or partially appear, run the cell again, as this glitch occurs on a couple of graphs and rerunning cell fixes visualization issue.
