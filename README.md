# Mod 1 Project

## Description

For the Mod 1 project, the problem posed is as follows: Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.

## The Data

The datasets used for this include tn.movie_budgets.csv and rotten_tomatoes_movies.csv which are included as zipped files in this repo, just unzip and you're good to go.
